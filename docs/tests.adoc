= Tests Documentation
In this documentation, we will specifi the test cases for the classes in order
to keep the system concise and avoid bugs in te future.

== Vec2 class

=== double length()
In order to get the magnitude, or length of the vecotor |A|, we simply
do pythagoras (h.sqr = a.sqr + b.sqr).

* The magnitue should always be positive, since it's squared of
real numbers:

----
x = -2; y = -5.2
sqrt(-2.sqr + -5.2.sqr) = 4.8
----

* If one of the elements is 0, then the length is equal the other
element:

----
x = 0; y = 15 
result = 15 

x = 23; y = 0 
result = 23
----

* If both the elements are 0, then the length 0:

----
x = 0; y = 0
result = 0
----

=== normalize()
To normalize a vector, we divide each of its components by it's length
here's some test cases:
