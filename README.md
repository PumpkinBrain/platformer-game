# 2d Platformer Game

In this project I will be making a 2d platformer game using C++, with the SFML and Google Test libraries.
The game will have asset and animation handling.

## Objectives:
The things I want to practice with this project are:
- designing, implementing and testing complex architectures
- writing documentation
- writing automated tests

# Current Status:
Now designing and implementing the Scenes management.

I do realize I might be doing some over-engineering, but I think it's good 
exercise for my learning process.
