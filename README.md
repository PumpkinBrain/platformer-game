# 2d Platformer Game

In this project I will be making a 2d platformer game using c++ and sfml

The game will have asset and animation handling

## Objectives:
The things I want to practice with this project are:
- planning, implementing and testing complex architectures
- writing documentation
- writing automated tests

# Current Status:
Currently I'm designing the architecture and learning tools to document my ideas
